11. ##### 11.	Chapter 1 does not discuss the MVC pattern specifically, and in a sense this entire course is an extended examination of the MVC pattern. Using an independent resource (such as Wikipedia) briefly state the responsibility of (a) the model, (b) the controller, and (c) the view.
- *Model - Model represents an object or JAVA POJO carrying data. It can also have logic to update controller if its data changes.

View - View represents the visualization of the data that model contains.

Controller - Controller acts on both model and view. It controls the data flow into model object and updates the view whenever data changes. It keeps view and model separate.*
